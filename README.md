## Perception Sensor Collaborative Effect and Cause Tree (PerCollECT) - Lidar Tree

This tree facilitates the analysis of cause and effect chain in the signal processing of automotive ultrasonic sensors. The tree is based on the following publication, which has to be cited if referring to PerCollECT:

C. Linnhoff, P. Rosenberger, S. Schmidt, L. Elster, R. Stark, and H. Winner, “Towards Serious Perception Sensor Simulation for Safety Validation of Automated Driving - A Collaborative Method to Specify Sensor Models,” submitted to the 24th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC), Indianapolis, IN, USA, 2021

## Visualization
